# Welcome to DHCP Project Site

This is a simple DHCP server and client simulation. I implemented it for computer network course spring 2021
The client can request to DHCP Server for being allocated the IP
This Project is Implemented in python from scratch and without any library ;)

## Getting Started
You can easily clone it and use it by terminal<br/>
First run server and then run client<br/>
you have to enter your mac address as input in clinet<br/>
Then you can see magic :)
